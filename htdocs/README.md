# Tetris Website

This is a website where you can play the game tetris and upload your scores which will then be posted on a leaderboard.

## Accessing the website

This was a university project where we used our own virtual machine so this is accessable using my azure virtual machine however if you import the files onto your virtual machine this should work as long as passwords and usernames are the same for your sql server.

## Playing Tetris

To play Tetris you can press the left, right, or down keys to either move the tetrimino, or you can press the up key to rotate the tetrimino. The game will end when the the tetriminos have been stacked to the top of the grid and the score will be your total score on the side of the page.
